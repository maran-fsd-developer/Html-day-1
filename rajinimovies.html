          as Rajinikanth,[b] is an Indian actor who predominantly works in Tamil
          cinema.[5] In a career spanning over five decades, he has done 170
          films[c] that includes films in Tamil, Hindi, Telugu, Kannada,
          Bengali, and Malayalam. He is widely regarded to be one of the most
          successful and popular actors in the history of Indian cinema.[6][7]
          Known for his uniquely styled mannerism and one liners in films, he

          Government of India honoured him with Padma Bhushan in 2000, Padma
          Vibhushan in 2016, India's third and second highest civilian honours,
          and the highest award in the field of cinema Dadasaheb Phalke Award in

          Following his debut in K. Balachander's 1975 Tamil drama Apoorva
          Raagangal, Rajinikanth's acting career commenced with a brief phase of
          portraying antagonistic characters in Tamil films. His major positive
          role as a scorned lover in S. P. Muthuraman's Bhuvana Oru Kelvi Kuri
          (1977), 1978's Mullum Malarum and Aval Appadithan received him
          critical acclaim; the former earned him a Tamil Nadu State Film Award
          Special Prize for Best Actor.[10][11] By the end of the decade, he had
          worked in all South Indian film industries and established a career in
          Tamil cinema. He then played dual roles in the action thriller Billa
          (1980), a remake of the Hindi film Don (1978). It was his biggest
          commercial success to that point, earned him stardom and gave him the
          action hero image.[12] He starred in triple role in Moondru Mugam
          (1982), which earned him a special prize at the Tamil Nadu State Film
          Awards ceremony. The following year, he made his Hindi film debut with
          T. Rama Rao's top grossing Andhaa Kaanoon (1983).[13] Nallavanukku
          Nallavan (1984) won him that year's Filmfare Award for Best Tamil
          Actor.[14] In the latter half of the 1980s, he starred in several
          successful films in Tamil and Hindi, including Geraftaar (1985),
          Padikkadavan (1985), Mr. Bharath (1986), Dosti Dushmani (1986),
          Velaikaran (1987), Manithan (1987), Dharmathin Thalaivan (1988) and
          ChaalBaaz (1989)

          In 1991, Mani Ratnam's Tamil crime film Thalapathi, earned him major
          critical acclaim for his performance.[18] He collaborated with Suresh
          Krissna for many films including Annaamalai (1992) and Baashha (1995);
          the latter was the biggest commercial success in his career yet as
          well as the highest-grossing film in Tamil for many years.[19] His
          other success includes P. Vasu's Mannan (1992), Uzhaippali (1993) and
          K. S. Ravikumar's Muthu (1995) and Padayappa (1999); the latter which
          went on to become his and Tamil cinema's highest-grossing movie,
          exceeding Baashha.
